# clog

Clog is a simple script to tail test.log a syslog that is typically generated by CGNAT on MX-SPC3.  
This script strips away some unnecessary parameters to match the log by MS-MPC.  Currently, the 
cleaned up log is send to console but can be easily modified to send via system or python3 log 
facilities.

Command:

`./main.py`

A demo can be viewed [here](https://asciinema.org/a/LfGPJHUbVZbOXgt7b3CSZ76Ib).  This recording will
be removed by 28/2/2022.

To simulate new logs going into `test.log`, you can open another terminal window and do:
`cat 1.log >> test.log` to create the 1st line of the sample log
`cat 2.log >> test.log` to create the 2nd line of the sample log

If you have access to more logs, you can simply concat mulitple lines into test.log. Main.py will 
run till it runs out of lines and then sleep for 1 second before checking again.
